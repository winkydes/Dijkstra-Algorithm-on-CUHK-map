# Dijkstra-Algorithm-on-CUHK-map
This is a project assignment from the course MATH2221 Mathematics Laboratory. In the following project I have used the Dijkstra Algorithm on a graph that represents the map of CUHK. I have turned all popular places as a node, and the paths between as edges. In this program, you can type in the starting location and ending location according to the node number in the diagram, and it will tell you the shortest path to travel through!

## Technologies
1. MATLAB

## How to run the program
1. Install MATLAB with an account from MathWorks (or any other platform that can run MATLAB)
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the file named "MATLAB_project"
4. Run the program in the MATLAB application
